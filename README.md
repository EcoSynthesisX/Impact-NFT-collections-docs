## EcoSyntesisX ImpactNFTs

# Project Overview
**Goal and Purpose:** Our NFT project has a dual mission. Firstly, we aim to onboard NGOs and communities to utilize web3 and blockchain tools for capital fundraising and global communication. Secondly, we strive to onboard impact creators, encompassing public goods and nonprofits, into the world of web3 and blockchain technology. The pilot collection for Koh Phangan features two NGOs, Phangan Animal Care for Strays and EcoThailand Foundation, along with the Clean Phangan community. These entities have significant positive impacts on the island, from caring for animals to cleaning beaches.

# NFT Collection Details
**Quantity and Theme:** We plan to mint 500 NFTs in the Impact NFT collection, with a lizard-themed design symbolizing the island's rich biodiversity.

**Beneficiary:** The Clean Phangan organization will receive 50% of the collection's proceeds. This organization focuses on beach clean-ups and promoting regenerative and environmentally friendly practices. Other NGOs will benefit in subsequent stages.

# Interactive Quests
**Real-World Engagement:** Our "irl quest with NFT" concept entails offering NFT holders exclusive real-world experiences. These experiences may include guided island tours, participation in beach clean-ups, and engagement in local sustainability projects. This approach deepens NFT holders' connections to our cause.

# Community Member NFTs
**Privileges and Engagement:** Community member NFTs grant various privileges, such as exclusive event access, early access to new NFT drops, and voting rights in project decisions. These NFTs aim to engage and reward dedicated community members. They will be distributed as rewards for positive actions within our island community.

# NFT Minting and Smart Contracts
**Blockchain Selection:** We are considering using the Optimism blockchain, Celo for its zero carbon footprint, or PGN public good network. The choice will depend on factors like gas fees, scalability, environmental impact, funding public goods, and ease of use.

**Smart Contract Features:** Smart contracts will include a royalty fee mechanism to allocate a portion of secondary sales to the Clean Phangan organization. Future stages will introduce minting, staking, breeding functions, and NFTs with bonuses or discounts, all integrated into a circular economy app.

# User Experience (UX) and Design
**Artwork and Sustainability:** We prefer artwork and metadata that celebrate the island's natural beauty and promote sustainable and regenerative economic practices.

**Marketplace:** Initially, the Impact NFT collection will be executed on platforms like Fractal Visions and our website with minting capabilities. Some non-Impact NFTs may be manually created and distributed.

# Metadata and Token Standards

**Comprehensive Metadata:** Each NFT will include title and name, description, creator and NGO information, artwork, attributes, minting dates, token ID, external links, collection information, and goals. We plan to use existing NFT standards like ERC-721 or ERC-1155 for compatibility with popular marketplaces.

# Integration with NGOs

**Collaboration:** We will onboard NGOs with varying onboarding processes tailored to their structure and resources. Donations from NFT sales will directly support partnering NGOs and projects. NFT holders will have visibility into the positive impact of their contributions. NFTs may also fund future initiatives, such as Clean Phangan's NFT bond for beach clean-ups.

# Community Engagement

**Engagement Strategies:** We prioritize community engagement through regular updates, newsletters, social media interactions, community events, giveaways, contests, collaborations, and a viral marketing campaign.

# Smart Contract Auditing and Security

**Security Measures:** To ensure the safety of users' assets, we will perform comprehensive security audits, including code reviews, functional testing, security tools analysis, penetration testing, and architecture review. Proper access controls and upgrade mechanisms will be implemented.

# Ownership and Licensing

**IP Rights:** Intellectual property rights to the NFT artwork and content will be retained by the respective creators, with EcoSynthesisX as the entity developing, deploying, and distributing NFTs. Licensing terms will permit personal use and resale of the NFTs, with 50% of royalties directed to the Clean Phangan organization and project.

# Launch and Distribution

**Release Schedule:** The NFT collection will launch on a date announced to the public at least two weeks in advance. Early bird access members may receive an earlier release date. The launch will be accompanied by promotional campaigns targeting both global and local communities.

# Monetization and Revenue Model

**Revenue Streams:** Primary revenue will come from NFT sales, covering operational costs and supporting environmental initiatives. Transaction fees and royalties from secondary sales will further contribute. Other types of NFTs will direct capital from sales to fund specific initiatives.

# Legal and Regulatory Compliance

**Compliance Focus:** We are actively addressing legal aspects and regulatory compliance, especially concerning fundraising for NGOs through NFT sales. NFT revenue is considered donations and flows directly into partnered NFT wallets. Local aspects will be addressed in collaboration with partners, and consultation will be available from our project team.

# Timeline and Milestones

**Project Phases:** The project timeline includes phases for NFT minting, marketing, community engagement, and quest rollouts. The tentative launch date is set for 11/11/23, with detailed plans to be announced.
